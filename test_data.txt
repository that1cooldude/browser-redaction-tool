Hi Sarah,

I'm writing to confirm our meeting tomorrow at 2:30 PM at the office. I've attached the report you requested with the financial projections for Q3. 

By the way, I need to update my direct deposit information. My new account number is 123456789 at Chase Bank (routing: 021000021). Also, could you forward the health insurance forms to me at john.smith@example.com? My policy number is HI-12345678.

I'll be out of the office next week as I'm traveling to 123 Main Street, Boston MA 02108 to visit my parents. You can reach me on my cell at (555) 123-4567 if anything urgent comes up.

Thanks,
John

P.S. The new office Wi-Fi password is Acm3T3ch2023!

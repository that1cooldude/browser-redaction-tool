# Browser Redaction Tool - Architecture

This document outlines the architecture and design principles of the Browser Redaction Tool, a client-side document redaction application.

## Overview

The Browser Redaction Tool is designed to provide secure, privacy-focused document redaction capabilities that run entirely within the browser. No document data ever leaves the client's computer, ensuring maximum privacy and security for sensitive information.

## Core Principles

1. **Privacy by Design**: All processing happens in the browser; no data is sent to servers.
2. **Modularity**: The application is built with distinct, loosely-coupled modules.
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality works without advanced features, enhancing as available.
4. **Performance Focus**: Efficient algorithms and memory management for handling large documents.

## Module Structure

### Document Upload & Processing

- Handles file selection, validation, and parsing
- Extracts text and structure from various document formats
- Prepares documents for redaction processing
- Uses Pyodide to run Python libraries for complex document formats

### Rule Management

- Creates, edits, and manages redaction rules
- Provides templates for common sensitive data patterns
- Handles rule validation and storage
- Manages rule prioritization and application order

### Redaction Engine

- Applies redaction rules to document content
- Provides different redaction methods (character replacement, fixed replacement, etc.)
- Maintains original document structure while applying redactions
- Tracks redaction statistics and metadata

### Export

- Generates redacted documents in various formats
- Handles watermarking and metadata cleanup
- Creates audit records of all redactions
- Provides download capabilities

### Pyodide Integration

- Manages Python runtime in WebAssembly
- Handles Python package installation and management
- Bridges JavaScript and Python for document processing

## Data Flow

1. User uploads a document
2. Document is parsed and analyzed
3. User configures redaction rules
4. Rules are applied to the document
5. User reviews and approves redactions
6. Redacted document is generated for export
7. Audit log is created with redaction statistics

## Security Considerations

- All processing runs client-side to prevent data exfiltration
- No network requests with document content
- Optional encryption for documents during browser processing
- Clear memory after processing to prevent data leakage

## Performance Considerations

- Large documents are processed in chunks to manage memory usage
- Web Workers for CPU-intensive tasks to prevent UI blocking
- Efficient algorithms for pattern matching and replacement
- Memory monitoring to prevent browser crashes with large files

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Document Processing**: Pyodide (Python in WebAssembly)
- **Python Libraries**: PyPDF2, pandas, regex, PIL/Pillow
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage, IndexedDB for larger documents

## Future Extensions

- Collaborative redaction with secure sharing
- Advanced OCR capabilities for image-based documents
- Machine learning-based sensitive data detection
- Browser extension for enhanced capabilities

# Requirements for Browser-Based Document Redaction Tool

## 1. Core Features

- Support document upload and parsing for common formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Enable multiple redaction methods (manual selection, automated pattern matching, AI/ML detection)
- Provide real-time preview of redacted content with highlighted areas
- Support export to multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, PNG, JPEG) with irreversible redactions
- Enable batch processing of multiple documents
- Support OCR for scanned PDFs and image-based documents
- Handle password-protected documents with user-provided credentials
- Implement a comprehensive rule management system for creating, testing, and saving redaction rules

## 2. User Interface (UI/UX)

- Create an intuitive drag-and-drop file upload interface
- Provide clear visual indicators for redacted areas
- Implement a responsive design compatible with desktop and mobile devices
- Follow WCAG accessibility guidelines for inclusive usage
- Enable customization of redaction styles (color, opacity, replacement text)
- Design an intuitive rule management interface with real-time preview
- Display progress indicators for document processing and batch operations
- Support multiple languages and localization
- Provide clear, actionable error messages and feedback mechanisms

## 3. Technical Implementation

- Use Pyodide to run Python code in the browser via WebAssembly
- Ensure compatibility with essential Python libraries (pdfminer.six, regex, etc.)
- Implement JavaScript-Python interoperability for optimal performance
- Process large files in chunks to avoid memory overload
- Utilize Web Workers for parallel processing and preventing UI freezing
- Implement memory monitoring with warnings when approaching browser limits
- Apply lazy loading techniques for large documents
- Integrate OCR capabilities for processing scanned documents
- Develop robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

## 4. Privacy and Security

- Ensure all processing happens client-side with no data transmission
- Implement in-memory processing with no persistent storage unless requested
- Apply encryption for sensitive data during processing
- Provide transparent documentation of privacy measures
- Enable offline functionality to reinforce privacy guarantees
- Include visual indicators confirming client-side processing
- Implement network monitoring to verify no data leaves the browser
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR, HIPAA)

## 5. Rule Management

- Create a user-friendly regex builder with examples and tooltips
- Support real-time testing of rules on sample text
- Enable saving and loading rule sets as reusable templates
- Provide pre-built templates for common use cases (SSNs, credit cards, etc.)
- Implement rule prioritization and conflict resolution
- Support contextual redaction based on surrounding content
- Enable batch application of rule sets across multiple documents
- Implement role-based access control for template management (if authentication is enabled)

## 6. Document Handling

- Handle multi-layer PDFs by flattening before redaction
- Process scanned PDFs with OCR for text extraction
- Support manual area redaction for image-based documents
- Manage complex DOCX formatting (tables, headers, footers)
- Remove or redact track changes and comments in DOCX files
- Replace redacted text with customizable placeholders in TXT files
- Support common image formats (PNG, JPEG) with area-based redaction

## 7. Export and Audit

- Ensure permanent, irreversible redactions in all exported formats
- Strip sensitive metadata from exported documents
- Optionally include audit logs detailing redaction activities
- Provide export options for different quality levels and file sizes
- Enable document flattening for PDFs to merge all layers
- Support batch export with consistent naming conventions

## 8. Performance Optimization

- Optimize memory usage for large document processing
- Implement chunked processing for files exceeding browser memory limits
- Use efficient algorithms for pattern matching to avoid performance bottlenecks
- Cache intermediate results to prevent redundant processing
- Provide performance metrics for optimization and troubleshooting
- Support large-scale batch processing with optimized resource usage

## 9. Development and Deployment

- Structure the GitHub repository with clear organization
- Create comprehensive documentation including setup and usage guides
- Implement unit and integration testing for all components
- Support browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Choose an appropriate open-source license
- Establish clear contribution guidelines for the community
- Implement continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)

## 10. Additional Features

- Provide interactive tutorials for first-time users
- Implement optional user authentication for saving preferences
- Enable collaboration features for team-based redaction
- Support version control for tracking changes to redactions
- Allow optional integration with cloud storage services
- Implement a feedback mechanism for bug reports and feature requests

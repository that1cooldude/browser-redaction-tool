Document Format Support and Semantic Redaction Implementation

We have successfully implemented two key features to enhance the redaction tool for AI system inputs:

1. Multiple Document Format Support
   - Added a flexible DocumentProcessor class hierarchy with specialized processors for different document types
   - Now supports PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, HTML, and images via OCR
   - Gracefully handles missing dependencies with informative error messages
   - Extracts and displays document metadata
   - Integrated with the UI for a seamless file loading experience

2. Semantic Redaction Capabilities
   - Created an EntityTracker to maintain consistent replacements throughout documents
   - Implemented intelligent pseudonymization for different entity types
   - Added context-preserving redaction to maintain document flow and readability
   - Provided options in the UI to toggle context preservation and pseudonymization
   - Allows consistent replacement of the same entities across documents

These enhancements make the redaction tool much more effective for AI system inputs by:
- Supporting a wider range of input formats employees might need to process
- Preserving document context and flow to maintain the utility of the text
- Using consistent entity replacements that prevent AI systems from making inferences
- Providing users with fine-grained control over the redaction process

Future work could include:
- Batch processing multiple files
- Additional output format options
- AI-specific content detection (like prompt injection prevention)
- Inference protection to prevent reconstruction of redacted information
